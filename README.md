# Instructions

As part of our training at Becode, we were asked to create a fullstack app dedicated to badge attribution.

## Objectives

Our objectives for this project were to create a fullstack application with a relational database,many-to-many relationships.
We have to create a basic permission system which allows badge administrators as well as users to log in to their account.

With following features included:

- All badges and users listed
- Possibility for administrators to create a badge and grant them to users
- Users having access to their acquired badges
- Administrators being able to add new users in the system
- A stats view for both administrators and users
